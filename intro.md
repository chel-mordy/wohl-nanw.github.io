## Introduction

### [Why Does The WOHL Exist?](#why)
Offline leagues like the WOHL exist because the league system implemented in EA's NHL is lacking the depth that competivive hockey players crave. After playing drop-ins for a while and maybe even griding a club for a bit, one realises that there could be more to it. That's where LG and others stepped in. However, if you live on the West coast of Canada or the United States finding games and playing on good ping is still an issue.

### [What Is The WOHL?](#what)
The WOHL aims to be the premier Western Only Hockey League (WOHL) and our games are played on North America North-West (NANW). We still have plenty of players from Central and East that join our ranks and compete at the highest level. If you want to play on East ping, try LG, VG or any other league.

### [The Point](#point)
The WOHL is setup to fascilitate matching competetive hockey teams to play against each other on NANW servers. That's it. Everything else we do feeds into that goal.
