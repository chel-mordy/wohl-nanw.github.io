# Waiver Wire

## [Description](#description)
- When a player is released (waived) the player will go back into the pool of eligible players and become eligible for the Waiver Wire
- Waiver Wire will open on Fridays at 8:00 PM PST until 9:00 PM PST (pending any reschedules)
- Each team will select 1 player (if space permits) through input into the Waiver Wire form
- Commissioners are not responsible for making sure teams have their players on the list by the time indicated
- No exceptions will be made to teams not having someone, or having the wrong player, etc
- Transaction once completed will not be reversed
- The first WW will not happen until after late signups are closed after week2 games are played, including any reschedules
- The starting order of the WW will be based upon the schedule of the teams, worst to best
- Tie-breaker for teams with the same record will be reverse draft order, before trades
- As teams make claims, they will be moved to the bottom of the list, they will only move up the list as other teams are moved behind them
- Each week the teams records will determine the draft order worst to best, except those that have already selected previously (bottom of the list)
- We will continue to track records for ordering if|until every team has selected a WW at least once
- Roster space is required to select a player, otherwise no selection is made
- Only eligible FA are allowed to be selected, players that join after the late signup deadline are excluded
