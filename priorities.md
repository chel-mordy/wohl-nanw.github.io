## WOHL Priorities for League Officials
For the WOHL to succeed, league officials that are entrusted to help run it, must adhere to these priorities in order:

### 1) The League
- DO help fascilitate the growth and success of the WOHL
- DON'T DO anything to the determiment of the WOHL's purpose (to provide a platform for competitive hockey on NANW servers)

### 2) The Players
- DO support the players in having an enjoyable, competitive experience
- DON'T DO anything that harms harmful or toxic towards any number of players

### 3) The Team
- DO build a cohesive team, and compete for the cup
- DON'T OD anything that sabotages a team's competitive chances in league play and standings
- _As team Owners, GMs and AGMs want their teams to be competitive, remember this is the third priority in this list_

This is written in this order on purpose. Where conflicts arise, adhere to the higher principal first.
