## WOHL Official Priorities
For the WOHL to succeed, officials that are entrusted to help run it must adhere to the priorities in order:

### 1) The League
- don't do anything to the determiment of the WOHL's purpose (to provide a platform for competitive hockey on NANW servers)

### 2) The Players
- don't do anything that harms the enjoyment of competitive play for any number of players

### 3) The Team
- don't do anything that sabotages a team's competitive chances in league play and standings
- _this is especially important as the third priority of team management_

This is written in this order on purpose. Where conflicts arise, adhere to the higher principal first.
