## WOHL Official Priorities
For the WOHL to succeed, officials that are entrusted to help run it must adhere to the priorities in order:
- `The WOHL itself`: don't do anything to the determiment of the WOHL's purpose (to provide a platform for competitive hockey on NANW servers)
- `The WOHL players`: don't do anything that harms the enjoyment of competitive play for any number of players
- `The WOHL team`: don't do anything that sabotages a team's competitive chances in league play and standings

This is written in this order on purpose. Where conflicts arise, adhere to the higher principal first.
