## Trades

WOHL is a league driven off a draft and player trades, not a bring-your-own-team league. As such _every player_ must understand that they have very little say on to which team they get drafted or traded.

### [Trade Request (TR)](#trade-request)
- Owners nor GMs can be traded
- Every other player in the league can be traded (and will not be notified ahead of time)
- Every player starts each season with ONE (1) trade request
- Once used, a player will not be given another TR in that season
- When a player invokes a TR, it will be privately in DMs to team Owner and|or GM
- A player has no say where they will traded; attempting to dictate where is tampering

### [Management Performing Trades](#management-performing-trades)
- is NOT required to perform a TR for a player, but should consider for the betterment of their team
- shall not threaten to trade a player to another team's rival; doing so is [tampering](trade.md#tampering)
- shall not hide reduced availability that the player has communicated to them; doing so is [dishonest-trade](trade.md#dishonest-trade)
- shall not encourage a player to invoke a TR, play poorly or do anything in an effort to get traded off of their current team; doing so is [tampering](trade.md#tamperting)

### [Executing a Trade](#executing-a-trade)
- Teams will discuss the details in DMs
- Teams may agree to trade draft picks; the number of picks traded must be equal for both teams
- Screenshots will be sent to Commissioners
- Commissioners can object to lopsided trade agreements
- Commissioners that are affected directly be trades won't participate in evaluation
- Trades that are approved are sent to the Media team for announcement
- Any players that quit as a result of a trade will face discipline [quitting due to trade](trade.md#quitting-due-to-trade)
