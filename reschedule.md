- They need to give notice to the other team at least 30mins before game time, where possible
- They need to explore getting other teammates to play instead of missing persons
- They need to try to get an ECU to replace players unable to make it, if possible
- If no other option is available, a reschedule can be invoked
- The game must be played before the start of the next week's schedule

- If teams mangement from both teams can't agree on a game time, commissioners will decide
