## Discipline

## [Non-league Players](#non-league-players)
Any discipline below that involves suspension or Discipline Committee Review for a non-league player, will automatically result in losing access to channels in Discord, or kicked if appropriate.

## [Discord](#discord-discipline)

### [Warning](#discord-warning)
A league official may mute a player at any time if their behavior is causing a distraction to the normal function of the league Discord. Often the discussion will then transfer to DMs between the player and the official. If the official feels like the player understands and has committed to change the behavior, chatting priviledges will be returned. If the player turns combative and confrontational, it may lead to further discipline; see below.
