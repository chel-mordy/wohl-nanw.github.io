## Grace
- Grace may be called when a team cannot make the schedule game time
- Grace of up to 15m may be called
- If more grace than that is needed then an agreement must be made prior to the original time expiring
- If an agreement cannot be made and the original 15m grace period ends then
    - team late can ASK for a reschedule, but non-late team, is NOT compelled to give it (see [Reschedule a Game](reschedule.md))
    - OR on-time team can ask late team to take a penalty to start the game
    - OR will be a FF for the team not able to ice a team
