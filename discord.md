## [Privilege not Right](#privilege-not-right)
Discord is the primary way the league and the players communicate with one another. The WOHL is free to play. Communicating within the WOHL Discord is a `privilege` *NOT* a `right`.
- The WOHL nor its league officials owe anyone the ability to chat in the team Discord
- Misbehave and expect this ability to be suspended or revoked

Note: Discord is the primary communication, but the following discipline extends to PSN chat, text messages, social media, etc.
