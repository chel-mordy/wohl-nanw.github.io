## Ragging the Puck
- A Player or team may not attempt to hold the puck in their defensive zone in order to kill time off the clock for any reason
- You are permitted to reset a breakout by moving the puck backward but the puck must be moved out of the defensive zone within 3 seconds. Should this be a regular occurrence throughout the game, it may be considered as a delay tactic and may result in a replay of the game or management suspensions
- No ragging the puck. Players may retreat to the defensive zone for a breakout situation while at even strength, or as a penalty kill technique while the opposing team has a player advantage. Any other circumstances when a human skater retreats to the defensive zone with no intentions of attacking, will have been found to be “puck ragging” and is eligible for disciplinary sanctions by the Association. In some cases, when the quality of the gameplay has been severely compromised by puck ragging (multiple times in a game) more serious team sanctions may occur, including a forfeit loss for that game
- Illegal play can result in discipline (see [Not Playing Properly](discipline.md#not-playing-properly))
